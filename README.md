# Deep-Q-Learning-for-Emotional-Lighting

# Introduction

In this project, we use a pre-trained ResNet50 model and train the deep Q-learning algorithm to predict
human emotions based on facial expressions in real-time and then translate these predictions into
ambient lighting effects. The goal is to build a responsive environment that might get adjusted based on
the mood of its user, and therefore improve their user experience. The strategy includes early
processing of images to desire god and fine-tuning a deep Q-network on grey-scale colours alone that
can anticipate emotions at line, following by recreating the expected light colours with their assigned
feelings. Performance of the system is evaluated measuring different metrics.Results showed that our
light form hella emotional lighting. This reveals promising uses of this work in smart homes, therapy
spaces and interactive installations
