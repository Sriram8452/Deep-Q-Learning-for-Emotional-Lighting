# Deep-Q-Learning-for-Emotional-Lighting

# Introduction

In this project, we use a pre-trained ResNet50 model and train the deep Q-learning algorithm to predict
human emotions based on facial expressions in real-time and then translate these predictions into
ambient lighting effects. The goal is to build a responsive environment that might get adjusted based on
the mood of its user, and therefore improve their user experience. The strategy includes early
processing of images to desire god and fine-tuning a deep Q-network on grey-scale colours alone that
can anticipate emotions at line, following by recreating the expected light colours with their assigned
feelings. Performance of the system is evaluated measuring different metrics.Results showed that our
light form hella emotional lighting. This reveals promising uses of this work in smart homes, therapy
spaces and interactive installations

# Problem Definition
Facial expression emotion detection is a hard The one that is quite a challenging task and needs to be
dealt with highly resilient models, different examples of expressions, lighted circumstances and
individual differences. It often performs poorly on traditional methods leading to discrepancies in the
predictions.The project solution by leveraging the workhorse of the field:reinforcement learning with
deep Q-learning. Deep learning for improved predictive power of the mode emotions accurately. Further,translation of these real-time lighting adjustments from emotional predictions layered
complexity that needs to be smoothly executed combination of hardware and software modules.

# Motivation
This project was inspired from the increasing number of studies on human emotion-adaptive smart
environments. But these environments can potentially deliver an amazing user experience, by offering a
tailor made and highly responsive environment. For example, lighting which caters depending on the
emotional state of Patients can enhance therapeutic settings by promoting relaxation or stimulation. Smart homes also adjust mood lighting depending on the emotional level of people inside, making
home a more comfortable and lively space as well. There is huge possibility of use cases varying from
entertainment and gaming to health care and education which makes this area interesting as well. 

# Objective
The main purpose of this research is to come up with a deep Q-learning model that can be used in
predicting human emotions using facial expressions. Moreover, the project seeks to link these forecasts
to lighting outcomes that would result in an adaptive environment. Accordingly, the tasks that will be
conducted include the pre-processing of data sets for uniformity, developing and training a deep Q- network based on a pretrained ResNet50 model and assessing its performance through extensive
metrics. Finally, this project aims at proving that deep reinforcement learning can be applied for
emotional lighting applications.

# LITERATURE SURVEY
Emotion detection has been one of the most researched issues in computer vision. The methodology
used in past research applied manually crafted features combined with traditional machine learning
algorithms that struggle to handle the complexity of facial emotions. With deep learning, CNNs which
are substantially more accurate than others approaches have been used as a standard in emotion
recognition. Recent research on transfer learning has utilized big data to explore the deployment of
trained ResNet model. In addition to that, while reinforcement learning has shown promise across
several applications, its application on emotion recognition and adaptive lighting are less explored. Inspired by recent advancements a particularly deep Q-learning with pre-trained ResNet50 goal of this
effort is to improve on the weaknesses in earlier (end-to-end model-free) approaches.
